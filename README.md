# Mastering_OOP

I use this book to learn advanced Python:
Steven F. Lott: Mastering Object-Oriented Python, 2019.

It focuses on special methods, design patterns, serialisation and object oriented
testing and debugging.

There's a [repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Object-Oriented-Python-Second-Edition)
that contains all the code from the book.

Here however, I play around with it and try things.
